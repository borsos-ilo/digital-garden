Or more simply: a list of various tools I used to build this website.

## Tech stack

I used [Astro.js](https://astro.build/) and the [Retypeset](https://github.com/radishzzz/astro-theme-retypeset) template to build the site.

## Appearance

The fonts used on the site are [League Script](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/League+Script) (title) and [Stix](https://www.stixfonts.org/) (remaining text).

I have the favicon thanks to [Freepik](https://www.freepik.com/icon/sunflower_7403160#fromView=keyword&page=1&position=5&uuid=4c05220d-78ca-412d-87a9-8b8d1bf7d075).

## Hosting & other

Since I'm a mediocre programmer, I use [Cline](https://cline.bot/) to help me throughout the entire process.

The site is entirely static - hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), in the process of moving to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com), as soon as I also move the domain there from [home.pl](https://home.pl)
