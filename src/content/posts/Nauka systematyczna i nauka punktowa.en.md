## TL;DR

Effective learning requires a conscious choice between a systematic and a point-based approach, depending on the goal and context. This allows for more efficient knowledge acquisition and the responsible application of that knowledge in practice.

## Introduction

One of the most important insights that helped me learn more effectively was realizing that learning can be approached in two ways: *systematically* or *point-by-point*—and that choosing the right method for the specific goal is crucial for both efficiency and the responsible use of that knowledge.

*A small digression: I am sure someone else has described this distinction better elsewhere, but I couldn't find the exact terminology. For the purpose of this post, I will use my own working definitions.*

### Systematic Learning

I define systematic learning as the process of learning a subject from the ground up, gradually deepening my understanding of various topics to eventually gain broad, solid competencies in a given field, and ultimately mastering a specific aspect of it.

My study of psychology is primarily a process of systematic learning—a long-term, structured, and planned process starting from the basics, focused on acquiring and reinforcing foundational knowledge.

Such thorough and extensive knowledge is crucial when I plan to use it while working with people. Gaps in knowledge could have serious consequences—both for me and for the people I will be working with.

#### Example

I begin my psychology studies with an "Introduction to Psychology" course and by reading a foundational textbook (for example, ["Psychology and Life"](https://www.amazon.com/Psychology-Life-20th-Richard-Gerrig/dp/0205854593) by P. Zimbardo or ["Academic Psychology"](https://lubimyczytac.pl/ksiazka/115005/psychologia-akademicka-podrecznik-tom-1) edited by D. Doliński and J. Strelau).

Gaining this knowledge helps me realize the existence of further sub-fields within a domain as vast as psychology and gives me some rudimentary knowledge about them.

After mastering the basics, I can move on to more specific topics (e.g., [biological bases of psychology](https://www.amazon.com/Biological-Psychology-James-W-Kalat/dp/1337408204), [cognitive psychology](https://www.amazon.com/Cognitive-Psychology-Connecting-Mind-Research/dp/1337408271), [developmental psychology](https://www.amazon.com/Developmental-Psychology-Childhood-Adolescence-David/dp/1133491234))—and the whole process repeats. Ultimately, this allows me to gain both broad knowledge of psychology as a whole and the opportunity to find a niche in which I want to specialize.

The same applies to other fields of science—medicine, computer science, finance, religious studies, philosophy, etc. Mentors, teachers, trainers, and lecturers are often involved in this process.

I apply the same process when learning skills that are the foundation of a Product Manager's work and are not tied to specific domain knowledge—customer discovery, strategy, storytelling.

I assume that if I want to use certain knowledge to *significantly* impact reality, and do so responsibly without harming others, I should acquire that knowledge systematically.

### Point Learning

For me, point learning is the conscious intention to better understand very specific and significantly narrowed areas that I need for a particular purpose. It is a process heavily oriented toward solving a specific *problem*, where I try to gain the necessary knowledge in a *short amount of time*.

I would call my recent [process of building the FlyCards app](https://ilonaborsos.com/flycards-signup) "point learning." In short, I was frustrated by the inefficient process of creating high-quality flashcards for new Hungarian words (the kind that include images, translations, and example sentences), so I decided to write an iOS app to solve my specific problem. I am one of those people stuck in [tutorial hell](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/qrlx5m/what_exactly_is_tutorial_hell/)—fortunately, with ChatGPT or Claude at my disposal, I can quickly gain the knowledge I lack to solve my problem. In this case, my learning looked something like this:

When starting the implementation process, I didn't yet know what I would need to learn. Claude helped me develop an execution plan and helped me understand which knowledge gaps I needed to fill. The final "map" of new skills looked roughly like the image above.

In the point learning process, I start with an idea or a specific need—and as I break that idea down into its component parts, I realize what knowledge and skills I need to solve the problem. Unlike systematic learning, I don't care about the *breadth* of the knowledge gained or a full understanding of the topic. On the contrary, I ruthlessly focus only on what I need and cut out everything that has no practical significance for me.

The process of acquiring the domain knowledge necessary for my work is mostly point learning—at some point, I become aware of a concept I don't yet know or understand well, and I must acquire this (relatively narrow) knowledge in the shortest possible time so that I can quickly put it into practice. *Time* and the right balance between speed and accuracy are particularly important here.

Although I often use AI to assist me in this process now, in my professional work, I rely heavily on *subject matter experts*—people with deep domain knowledge who help me identify concepts I should learn more about to solve a problem and, ultimately, help me understand them better.

## Conclusions

One of the mistakes I (still) make is applying the wrong method to the wrong situation.

If I apply a point-based approach to situations where I should be learning systematically, I will never achieve mastery and will not be able to use my knowledge in a socially responsible way.

If I apply a systematic approach to situations where I should be learning point-by-point, I won't solve a critical problem in a short amount of time. In many cases, when I [have to choose between time and accuracy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkIds5Xxki4), time turns out to be the more important factor.

When learning point-by-point, I may fall into the trap of thinking I have understood the problem in its entirety—and I must remember that I haven't. [I am still a Visitor, not a Native](https://fsbooks.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/the+great+mental+models/1+general+thinking+concepts/sample_chapter.pdf).

I don't think either approach is inherently better or worse—they are simply tools I can use for appropriate purposes.
